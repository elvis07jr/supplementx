## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get SupplementX running locally for development and testing.

### 📋 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

*   🟩 **Node.js:** LTS version recommended.
*   <img src="https://bun.sh/logo.svg" width="16" height="16" alt="Bun Logo" /> **Bun:** Install via `npm install -g bun` or see [bun.sh](https://bun.sh).
*   🐙 **Git:** For cloning the repository.
*   👁️ **Watchman:** (macOS) `brew install watchman` for better Metro performance.
*   📱 **Expo Go App:** On your iOS or Android device.

### ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Magic:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url-here>
    cd SupplementX
    ```
    *(Replace `<your-repository-url-here>` with the actual repository URL)*

2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Power Up the Backend:**
    The backend (Hono/tRPC) is in the `backend/` directory.
    ```bash
    cd backend
    bun install
    cd ..
    ```

### ▶️ Running the Application

#### 📱 Mobile App (User Interface)

With Expo Go on your device:

```bash
# Verify command in package.json if needed
bunx rork start --tunnel
```
Scan the QR code from your terminal using the Expo Go app.

#### ⚙️ Backend Server

The heart of the app's data operations:

```bash
cd backend
bun run dev # Or your backend's start script from its package.json
```
This usually starts on `http://localhost:3000`. Ensure your app config points here in dev.

#### 🌐 Web Dashboards (Pharmacy/Courier)

Check `package.json` for specific scripts like:
*   `start-web`: `bunx rork start --web --tunnel`
*   `start-web-dev`: `DEBUG=expo* bunx rork start --web --tunnel`
