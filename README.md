## 4. Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 4.1 Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** (LTS version recommended)
*   **Bun:** Install via `npm install -g bun` or visit [Bun's official website](https://bun.sh/) for other installation methods.
*   **Git:** For cloning the repository.
*   **Watchman:** (Recommended for macOS users for better performance with Metro bundler) - `brew install watchman`
*   **Expo Go App:** Install on your iOS or Android device for running the mobile app.

### 4.2 Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url-here>
    cd SupplementX
    ```
    *(Replace `<your-repository-url-here>` with the actual URL of this repository)*

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Setup backend services:**
    The backend is powered by Hono and tRPC and is located in the `backend/` directory.
    ```bash
    cd backend
    bun install
    cd ..
    ```

### 4.3 Running the Application

#### 4.3.1 Mobile App (User Interface)

Ensure you have the Expo Go app installed on your mobile device.

```bash
# This is the typical start command, verify with package.json
bunx rork start --tunnel
```
Scan the QR code generated in the terminal with your Expo Go app. The `--tunnel` option allows devices not on the same local network to connect.

#### 4.3.2 Backend Server

The backend server (Hono/tRPC) needs to be running for the app to fetch data and perform operations.

```bash
cd backend
bun run dev # Or the script specified in backend/package.json
```
This will typically start the server on a local port (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). Ensure your mobile app's API calls are configured to point to this address during development.

#### 4.3.3 Web Dashboards (Pharmacy/Courier)

If web dashboards are part of this specific repository and have their own startup scripts (e.g., within a `dashboard/` folder or as part of the main `package.json`), refer to those specific instructions. The `package.json` includes:
*   `start-web`: `bunx rork start --web --tunnel`
*   `start-web-dev`: `DEBUG=expo* bunx rork start --web --tunnel`

## 5. Project Structure

A brief overview of the key directories:

*   `app/`: Contains the screens and navigation logic for the React Native mobile application (using Expo Router).
